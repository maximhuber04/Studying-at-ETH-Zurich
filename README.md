Introduction to human-computer interaction and the design of systems that work for people and their organizations. The goal is to understand the manner in which humans interact with, and use, their computers for productive work. The course focus is on the interface as designed artifact. The interface is a design problem without a single "correct" solution but which has many "good" solutions and a plethora of "bad" solutions. Class discussion centers on what makes an interface good and proven techniques for designing interfaces that meet human needs.

Intro to Bayesian Statistics <a href="https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/4920/WCAS/STAT/16932">STAT 357</a>
</summary>
<p>
The purpose of this course is to provide an elementary introduction to a variety of computational algorithms for the Bayesian analysis of data. Two types of methods are considered in detail: observed data and data augmentation methods. The observed data methods are applied directly to the likelihood or to the posterior distribution. These include: Newton-Raphson, Monte Carlo and Metropolis methods. The data augmentation methods rely on an augmentation of the data which simplifies the likelihood or posterior distribution. These include: EM, Data Augmentation, and the Gibbs sampler. All methods are motivated and illustrated with real examples. Overall, this course provides the student with a good introduction to the field, the ability to read application papers, and the ability to apply these methods to problems of interest to the student. Students understand at a heuristic level how the methods work and when a given method may be preferred over another.
